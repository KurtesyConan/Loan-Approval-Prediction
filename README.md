# Loan-Approval-Prediction

Loan Approval Prediction is a machine learning project that utilizes Python to predict loan approval outcomes. This project is useful for fintech businesses like banks and financial institutions to automate the loan approval process. By analyzing historical loan data and applying machine learning algorithms, this code can help determine whether a loan application is likely to be approved or not.

## Overview and Dataset

The code analyzes various factors such as the applicantâ€™s financial history, income, credit rating, employment status, and other relevant attributes. It leverages historical loan data to build a machine learning model for predicting loan approvals.

You can find the dataset used for this project [here](link_to_dataset).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to use the code for loan approval prediction:

1. Install the necessary Python libraries mentioned in the code using `pip install`.

2. Download the dataset from the provided link and place it in the same directory as the code file.

3. Run the code to perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model training.

4. The code will output the predicted loan approval results.

## Data Preprocessing

The code handles missing values in both categorical and numerical columns. It also performs outlier removal to ensure data quality.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is carried out to understand the distribution of various factors and their relationship with loan approval status. Visualizations are included to help users interpret the data.

## Model Training

The code uses the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to train the loan approval prediction model. You can explore other machine learning algorithms for comparison.

## Results

The predicted loan approval values are displayed in the output. You can analyze the results to understand the model's performance.
